# Final Course Project 2021
## Averaging Weights Leads to Wider Optima and Better Generalization

The code in this repository implements three loss optimization algorithms: conventional SGD, SWA and improved SWA. 
For each algorithm, we used the VGG16 model and evaluated the model on eleven different dataset taken from https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html/ 

### Usage
The code is based on the paper authors' code which can be seen in https://github.com/timgaripov/swa.
We implemented our project in Google Collaboratory in order to get GPU and memory resources. However, one can download the code as a regular python file.
